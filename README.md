**Quick Note:**

I am uploading this because I am interested in doing front-end development. 

## Purpose:

Developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap, a simple TO-DO app designed with mobile in mind, although some CSS flare, such as hover, used in the desktop size. 
The goal of this project was to have interaction with local storage and try to only rely on "pure" Javascript.
